### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently working on a website for my Dairy operation to showcase the products that we offer, and what we do on a day to day. 
I'm looking to collaborate on multiple levels with anyone that likes to code! I'm looking for help with anything that helps me learn more skills. Fun Fact: I love to be outdoors in the mountains and near a stream, river, or lake.
